Christmas Holiday App with Currency Conversion

Elevator Pitch:
Planning to go to Europe for the Christmas season?
Do you worry about exchanging currencies from Canadian dollars to Euros?
Say hello to our Christmas Holiday App with Currency Conversion! This app makes holiday shopping and budgeting much easier by providing the exchange rate from Canadian dollars to Euros in real-time.


Concept:
The Christmas Holiday App is a one-stop-shop for holiday shopping, with a currency converter feature that displays prices in real-time. With the currency converter feature, you can compare prices across multiple stores and make informed decisions.

Motivation for Development:
The holiday season can be stressful, especially when you're shopping in a foreign country. Our goal is to make the holiday shopping experience easier and less stressful. With the Christmas Holiday App, you no longer have to worry about exchange rates, or how much you're spending in a foreign currency.

Process:
Technologies used: We used Visual Studio Code for programming. Also we used github to keep us updated along with the programming languages of HTML,CSS and Javascript. After class meetings and discussions were held on Discord.
Breakdown of tasks and roles: We did our best to divide the work evenly. We structured the project by working on the rough copy of html, css, html and made edits such as bugs that would make the website load correctly, syntax errors, javascript errors. 
The roles were mutually worked on on addressing bigger issues but were allocated different smaller task such as editing html, plan on styling ,task management which were handled by Tony. Moreover Mohamed was allocated on creating, editing, HTML, CSS and also connecting javascript API’s and also worked on bugs on the project and updated the boards.

Difficulties and Resolutions:
Challenges: We faced was updating the API’s and connecting them was a huge hurdle. Luckily, with the help of several leaders, we were able to solve the issue.
Successes : We worked hard and diligently, often doing sessions outside of class to plan and work on eliminating bugs on html,css and javascript. We persevered and completed the app. Also to note the major success was teamwork and understanding and taking necessary steps to help each other out when needed. The TA’s, Mark and Stephen were tremendously helpful.
